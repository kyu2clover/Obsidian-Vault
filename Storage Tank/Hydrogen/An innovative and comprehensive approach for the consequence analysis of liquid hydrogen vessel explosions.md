## Abstract

Hydrogen is one of the most suitable solutions to replace hydrocarbons in the future. Hydrogen consumption is expected to grow in the next years. [Hydrogen liquefaction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hydrogen-liquefaction "Learn more about Hydrogen liquefaction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is one of the processes that allows for increase of hydrogen density and it is suggested when a large amount of substance must be stored or transported. Despite being a clean fuel, its chemical and physical properties often arise concerns about the safety of the [hydrogen technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hydrogen-technology "Learn more about hydrogen technologies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). A potentially critical scenario for the [liquid hydrogen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/liquid-hydrogen "Learn more about liquid hydrogen from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (LH2) tanks is the catastrophic rupture causing a consequent boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE), with consequent overpressure, fragments projection and eventually a fireball. In this work, all the BLEVE consequence typologies are evaluated through theoretical and analytical models. These models are validated with the experimental results provided by the BMW care manufacturer safety tests conducted during the 1990's. After the validation, the most suitable methods are selected to perform a blind prediction study of the forthcoming LH2 BLEVE experiments of the Safe [Hydrogen fuel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hydrogen-fuel "Learn more about Hydrogen fuel from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") handling and Use for Efficient Implementation (SH2IFT) project. The models drawbacks together with the uncertainties and the knowledge gap in LH2 physical explosions are highlighted. Finally, future works on the modelling activity of the LH2 BLEVE are suggested.

## 6. Conclusions

In this study, a thorough consequence analysis of LH2 BLEVEs for both small- and mid-scale tests was conducted for the first time by evaluating all the consequence typologies (pressure wave, fragments, and fireball). The analytical and theoretical models usually employed in risk analysis were adopted, and an underestimation was observed when the outcomes were compared with the experimental results. The drawbacks(단점) of the models were highlighted together with different uncertainties such as the behaviour of the double walled tank and of LH2 during the evolution of the BLEVE phenomenon. It can be concluded that a broad knowledge gap is still present regarding the LH2 physical explosions.

##3.1.2. Fragments range (BLEVE 가 발생하는 시나리오)

The correlation(상관관계)suggested by (Birk, 1996) to estimate the horizontal range of the fragments of a propane tank during a BLEVE explosion was implemented in this work. This correlation, reported in Eqs. (23), (24), depends only on the mass of the substance contained in the vessel (mT) and its volume (VT).

Since this method usually overestimates the fragments range, the methodology proposed by [CCPS (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423020306100?dgcid=raven_sd_recommender_email) was adopted in this consequence analysis as well. The [initial velocity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/initial-velocity) of the fragments is estimated with the correlation presented by [Baum (1984)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423020306100?dgcid=raven_sd_recommender_email) in Eq. [(25)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423020306100?dgcid=raven_sd_recommender_email):

###3.3.1.2. Fragments range

Conducting research on the safety of liquefied hydrogen (LH2), BMW is currently cooperating with Messer Griesheim GmbH and Linde AG in a series of research operations and tests serving first to determine the hazard potential of LH2 tanks used in road vehicles, taking into consideration in the process the various parameters influencing the effects of this hazard, and second to determine further requirements to be made of such vehicle tanks in their basic concept. This experimental research is funded by the commission of the European Communities (CEC) as part of the EQHHPP (Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot Project).

###4.1.5. Safety distance
In this work, the safety distance is determined from the consequence analysis results. The highest value between the distance where the overpressure and impulse thresholds to avoid injuries are attained (52 m), the longest horizontal fragments range (65 m), the fireball diameter (13.9 m) and the distance to obtain the lowest thermal dose emitted from the fireball to the target (77.8 m), is considered as the safety distance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the safety distance from the vessel should be 77.8 m, due to the fireball radiation.
